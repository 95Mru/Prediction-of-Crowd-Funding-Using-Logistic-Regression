# Prediction of Crowd Funding Using Logistic Regression
Projects created by individuals and small companies has seen considerable number of investors showing interest in promising ideas. Crowdfunding has become an excellent alternative to savings, bank loans etc. Investors consider a lot of factors before investing their thought, time and money into the pitched startup project ideas. Taking such decisions can sometimes prove to be risky. This paper focuses on building a prediction model based on Scikit Learn’s Logistic Regression which uses optimization algorithms as hyperparameters to predict the success or failure of the ideas put forward for the year 2019. The variables used in this paper are not considered based on wild guesses, but rather considered based on previous work done in similar field. Data used for this project was obtained from the datasets provided in the Kickstarter website.  The preprocessing steps involved are converting the data to csv format, converting certain columns into a uniform format,  and then extracting the required stats such as “category of project”, “mean funding for each project” etc. to name a few. Logistic Regression along with the optimization algorithms gives better prediction results which were calculated by training the model over the past 10 years data. The accuracy of prediction is 70.18% on the test data.
